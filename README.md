## Project Information

### Project Name: Service Platform for Freelancers

## Brief Description

AutonoMeet is a platform that allows freelancers to offer their services (such as hairdressing, plumbing, private tutoring, etc.), while clients can easily search, book, and pay for these services. Users can register, browse services by category, view freelancer profiles, schedule appointments, and make online payments.

This project addresses:

1. Quickly establish their online presence.  
2. Manage their business efficiently.
